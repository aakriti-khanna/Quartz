            Sora White Pvt. Ltd. not only excels in manufacturing and exporting
            high-quality minerals but also has a strong foothold in the mining
            sector. Our mining operations are a testament to our commitment to
            excellence and sustainability in the mineral industry.  
          </p>
            <p className="Mining__description leading-loose" > With a focus
            on responsible mining practices, we operate five leased mines to
            ensure a consistent supply of premium raw materials for our
            manufacturing processes. These mines are managed with utmost care
            and adherence to environmental regulations, minimizing our
            ecological footprint.</p> 
            
            <p className="Mining__description leading-loose">Our mining endeavors prioritize safety,
            efficiency, and environmental stewardship. We employ modern mining
            techniques and technologies to extract minerals while minimizing
            environmental impact and maximizing resource efficiency.</p>

            <p className="Mining__description leading-loose">Furthermore, our mining operations are integrated seamlessly with
            our manufacturing unit, allowing for a streamlined production
            process that ensures the quality and consistency of our end
            products. This integration enables us to maintain strict quality
            control measures from extraction to the final product, guaranteeing
            customer satisfaction and loyalty. </p>

            <p className="Mining__description leading-loose">  At Sora White, mining isn't just
            about extractionâ€”it's about responsibly harnessing the Earth's
            resources to provide sustainable solutions for our valued customers
